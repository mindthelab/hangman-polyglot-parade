ðŸ‘¾ Hangman Game Programming Rules ðŸ‘¾

1. The game must be Hangman (obviously). This means implementing the good old guessing game where wrong guesses bring you to your untimely demise.

2. The secret word to guess is "banana." That's right, just a simple, humble banana. ill make sure the game can handle this yellow mischief-maker with grace.

3. Players get 5 lives. Each wrong guess consumes one life. Make it count, or itâ€™s game over. After all, even simplicity has its consequences.

4. No GPT or any kind of code completion. JUST DOCUMENTATION.

Thought there would be more rules? Nope, just these tÌ¶hÌ¶rÌ¶eÌ¶eÌ¶ four gems. Simplicity is key, but donâ€™t underestimate the challenge of coding a fruit-related existential crisis.

PS: i'll try to keep my code clean. No bananas were harmed, but my syntax might be.
