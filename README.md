    <h1>Welcome to the Hangman Polyglot Parade! ðŸŽ‰</h1>
    <p>
        Ever wondered how many ways you can hang a man (digitally, of course)? Look no further! This repository is my personal challenge to implement the classic game of Hangman in as many programming languages as possible. From the elegant whispers of Python to the stern orders of C, weâ€™re coding our way through a linguistic jungle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why? Because itâ€™s there, and because we can! Join me in this whimsical journey of syntax and semicolons. Expect code, chaos, and possibly some learning along the way. Each language brings its own flavor of torture for our poor stick figureâ€”don't miss it!
    </p>
    <p class="disclaimer">
        **Disclaimer:** No stick figures were harmed in the making of this repository (just me). Enjoy my existential crisis across multiple coding paradigms!
